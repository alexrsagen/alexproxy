# alexproxy
Aptly named `alexproxy`, this is my asynchronous HTTP(s) proxy
written in Golang.

Most of the server part is copied and modified from the Golang httputil package.

## Building
Requires the Golang runtime (and GNU Make if you want to make your life easier).

Run `make` to build, or if you're not on Linux, have a look at the
commands in the Makefile.
